### A bit about me
I am software developer based in Kazakstan and I have been building web applications for at least a year, which bring any ideas to life. I help to convert a vision and idea into something meaningful and useful as a software product. Take a look at my portfolio and let's see if we can work together.

### Main Skills
Express, React, Typescript, Rust/Axios.
